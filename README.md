**Academic Calender:**

**Project Name**: 
"My project is called 'Academic Calendar,' designed specifically for students, staff, and administrators of a college or university."

**Purpose and Motivation**: 
"The project addresses the need for a more efficient way to manage and track departmental events and placement schedules. It aims to solve problems related to communication gaps and the mismanagement of events, which are common in many educational institutions."

**Target Users**:
"The primary users are students, staff, and administrators. Each group benefits from different aspects of the platform: students stay informed about events, staff can manage schedules, and administrators oversee the entire process."

**Workflow:**

	The login panel serves both administrators and students. Administrators must enter a username and password for secure access to manage sensitive data. Students can easily log in as viewers with a simple button click, allowing quick access to general information while ensuring security for admin functions.

	Home Page: "The home page provides an overview of upcoming events, giving users quick access to various sections and ensuring easy navigation throughout the platform."

	Event Calendar: "This feature displays scheduled events in a calendar view, which helps users visualize and stay informed about upcoming activities."
